### Hints to work with the repo without a problem:

 Everyone has his/her own branch, We all work inside our own branches.

 1. Clone the repo first:
 ``` 
 git clone "your branch url" 
 ```
 3. Switch to your branch by:
  ```git checkout <your branch name> ```
 4. Do your changes.
 5. To push your changes to the repo follow the steps:
  * git
  ```sh
            git add .
            git commit -m "name your commit"
            git push origin "branch name"
  ```
